## About Mahedi Hasan Nabil
Hey! I am Mahedi Hasan Nabil. Welcome to my blog site, where I share my thoughts and insights on various topics related to technology, business, and lots of other things.

I am a business student and a flutter app developer. I have always been fascinated by the power and potential of technology to transform our lives and solve real-world problems. That's why I started learning how to code when I was eleven years old.

However, my passion for technology is not limited to coding. I also have a keen interest in the corporate side of the tech industry, where innovation meets strategy, management, and leadership. That's why I switched from a science major to a business major after my tenth grade exam. I wanted to learn more about how businesses operate, grow, and compete in the global market.

Since then, I have been involved in various activities and projects that combine my love for technology and business. For example, I have researched the stock market and invested in some companies. I have also tried to build a startup of my own, which was a great learning experience. And of course, I have developed several flutter apps for different purposes and platforms.

I have also done an internship in a tech company in order to learn about office culture and how tech companies operate.** It was an amazing opportunity to gain some practical skills and insights into the tech industry.

Through this blog site, I hope to share my knowledge and experience with you, as well as learn from your feedback and comments. I will write about topics such as app development, stock market analysis, tech trends, and more. I hope you will find my blog site useful and enjoyable.

Thank you for visiting and happy reading!ðŸ˜„
